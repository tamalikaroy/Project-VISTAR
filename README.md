## 📖 Executive Summary
**Project VISTAR** is a data intelligence initiative that bypasses traditional 10-year Census lags by utilizing real-time **UIDAI (Aadhaar)** administrative footprints. By analyzing the ratio of **Child Enrolments (0-5 years)** to **Adult Workforce Updates (18+)**, this project establishes the **Migration Pressure Index (MPI)** to map economic "Gravity Wells" across 250+ districts in 5 major Indian states.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Data Wrangling:** `Pandas` & `Regex` for "Nuclear Cleaning" (resolving administrative district renaming anomalies).
* **Geospatial Visualization:** `Plotly` & `Scipy` for 3D Topographic Surface Mapping.
* **Statistical Analysis:** `Seaborn` for Swarm Plot distribution of regional inequality.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **`data/raw/`**: 10 CSV datasets covering Enrolment and Update logs.
* **`notebooks/`**: Chronological analysis from individual state deep-dives to the final 3D synthesis.

## 🚀 Key Insights
1. **The State Average Paradox:** Revealed that UP's low index is driven by high bureaucratic compliance, while Karnataka's index reveals a sharp divide between its tech-capital and rural north.
2. **The 500x Gap:** Identified an exponential inequality gap between industrial magnets like **Bengaluru South** and labor source districts like **Pashchim Champaran**.
3. **Economic Tribes:** Proved through ML that industrial cities share more demographic DNA with each other across state borders than with their own rural neighbors.
